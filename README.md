Welcome to my first project as a student at campus19!

## Overview

In this introductory project, I am excited to create my own personal static library in the C programming language. This project marks the beginning of my journey at campus19 and provides an opportunity to dive into C programming concepts while building a fundamental software component.<br>

The project is called libft and is an exercise that requires you to use many things learnt during the piscine. Most of the functions in this project were written during the piscine (in one form or another).

## Mandatory functions


### Functions from `<string.h>` library
* [`ft_strlen`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft/blob/main/ft_strlen.c) - calculates the length of a string

### Functions from `<ctype.h>` library
* [`ft_isalnum`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft/blob/main/ft_isalnum.c) - tests if the character is a digit or alphabetical
* [`ft_isalnum`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft/blob/main/ft_isascii.c) - tests if the character is an ascii value


## Main Functions
In order to test the separate functions while coding, I used the main files that can be found in [`this repo`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft_main_functions).
