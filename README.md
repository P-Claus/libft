## Overview

In this introductory project, I am excited to create my own personal static library in the C programming language. This project marks the beginning of my journey at campus19 and provides an opportunity to dive into C programming concepts while building a fundamental software component.<br>

The project is called libft and is an exercise that requires you to use many things learnt during the piscine. Most of the functions in this project were written during the piscine (in one form or another).

## Mandatory functions


### Functions from `<string.h>` library
* [`ft_strlen`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft/blob/main/ft_strlen.c) - calculates the length of a string
* [`ft_memset`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft/blob/main/ft_memset.c) - copies the first n characters of the character c to the string, pointed to by *b
* [`ft_memcpy`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft/blob/main/ft_memcpy.c) - copies n bytes from memory address src to dst
### Functions from `<strings.h>` library
* [`ft_bzero`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft/libft/srcblob/main/ft_bzero.c) - erases the data in the n bytes of the memory
       starting at the location pointed to by s, by writing zeros
### Functions from `<ctype.h>` library
* [`ft_isalpha`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft/blob/main/ft_isalpha.c) - tests if the character is alphabetical
* [`ft_isdigit`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft/blob/main/ft_isdigit.c) - tests if the character is a digit
* [`ft_isalnum`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft/blob/main/ft_isalnum.c) - tests if the character is a digit or alphabetical
* [`ft_isascii`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft/blob/main/ft_isascii.c) - tests if the character is an ascii value


## Main Functions
I removed the main functions in the function files to hand in, but the files with a main function included are available in [`this repo`](https://github.com/P-Claus/libft_main_functions).
