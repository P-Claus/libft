# My First Campus42 Project: Personal Static Library in C

Welcome to my first project as a student at campus42!

## Project Overview

In this introductory project, I am excited to create my own personal static library in the C programming language. This project marks the beginning of my journey at campus42 and provides an opportunity to dive into C programming concepts while building a fundamental software component.
